Scripts for `~/.claude/scripts`

## Status Bar Setup

Manually set up the Claude Code status bar to display model, context usage, and cost at a glance — no more typing `/usage` to check where you're at.

### Steps

**1. Get the scripts**

The status bar depends on multiple files (`context-bar.sh`, `fetch-usage.sh`, etc.), so you need all of them. The easiest options:

**Option A — Clone directly into `~/.claude`:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-global-scripts ~/.claude/scripts
```

**Option B — Download ZIP:**

Download the ZIP from GitHub (Code → Download ZIP), then extract the contents into `~/.claude/scripts/`.

**2. Make the scripts executable**

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/*.sh
```

**3. Update `~/.claude/settings.json`**

Add the following to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/scripts/context-bar.sh"
  }
}
```

If you already have other settings in the file, add the `statusLine` block alongside them.

**4. Restart Claude Code**

The status bar will appear at the bottom of your terminal session.

### Dependencies

Requires `jq` for JSON parsing:

```bash
brew install jq       # macOS
apt install jq        # Linux
```

## Usage Pacing

The status bar automatically shows your weekly pacing:
- **Weekly usage**: Your current 7-day rolling usage
- **Target per session**: How much to use per remaining 5-hour session to hit 100%

Calculation: `(100% - weekly_usage) / sessions_remaining`

Sessions remaining is estimated at 3 per day for the rest of the month.
